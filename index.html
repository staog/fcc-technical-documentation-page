      <p>For years now Alfa Romeo has been developing its global commitment towards the safeguarding and protection of the Environment through the continuous improvement of its production processes and the making of increasingly more “eco friendly” products. With a view to guaranteeing the best possible service to clients in full observance of environmental standards and in response to the obligations imposed by European Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, Alfa Romeo offers its clients the possibility to hand in their vehicle* at the end of its life
      span without additional costs.</p>
      <p>The European Directive, in fact, provides for the take-back of the vehicle without the last holder or owner of the same incurring expenses due to the fact that the market value of the vehicle is zero or negative. In particular, in almost all of the countries of the European Union, up until 1st January 2007, take-back of the vehicle free of charge only applies to vehicles registered from 1 July 2002 on, while, from 2007 on, take-back will be carried out free of charge, independently of the year of registration, provided that the vehicle still contains all its essential component parts (especially engine and body) and is free from additional waste materials.</p>
      <li>Our contracted network of authorised treatment facilities has been carefully selected in order to provide a quality service to our customers by de-polluting and recycling “End of Life Vehicles” to approved environmental standards. To find out the location of your nearest authorised treatment facility, offering free of charge take-back, simply contact one of our dealers or refer to the Alfa Romeo web site or call the toll free number 00800 2532 0000.</li>
